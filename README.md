# LOGO! Web Dumper

Read and decode the circuit program from a **Siemens LOGO! 0BA5 / 0BA6** small PLC — entirely in your browser, no install, no Siemens software. (The device is auto-detected on connect; the 0BA5 path is implemented but so far only verified against the emulator, not real 0BA5 hardware.)

**Live tool: https://yonran.github.io/logo-web-dumper/**

## Compatibility

**Devices** — the serial-PG generations, auto-detected on connect:

- ✅ **LOGO! 0BA6** — `0BA6`, `0BA6.ES3`, `0BA6.ES10` (part `6ED1052-…-0BA6`). Primary target, tested on real hardware.
- ⚠️ **LOGO! 0BA5** — implemented (2-byte addressing), but **not yet verified on real 0BA5 hardware**.
- ❌ **LOGO! 0BA7 / 0BA8 (LOGO!8)** — **not supported**: these use Ethernet, a completely different protocol.
- ❌ **0BA4 and earlier** — not supported.

**Cable / serial link** — the 4-wire RS-232 **PG interface at 9600 8E1**, via the USB LOGO! programming cable (or any USB-serial adapter). The cable's USB-serial bridge can be FTDI, Silicon Labs CP210x, WCH CH340/CH341, or Prolific:

- **Web Serial** (desktop Chrome/Edge) — the **OS driver** configures the cable, so **any** chip with a driver works. Most reliable.
- **WebUSB** (desktop or Android) — this tool configures the chip itself: **CH340/CH341 is verified on hardware**; **CP210x and FTDI are best-effort / unverified**; unknown chips aren't configured.

**Browsers** — Chrome or Edge on desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux), or Chrome on Android via a USB-OTG adapter. **Safari, Firefox, and iOS are not supported** (they have neither Web Serial nor WebUSB).

## Why

Siemens' LOGO!Soft Comfort *Demo* can't transfer programs (the Transfer menu is disabled without a paid license). This tool talks the LOGO! **PG serial protocol** directly through your USB programming cable, so you can dump and read a 0BA6 program for free.

- **Desktop (Chrome/Edge):** uses the Web Serial API — plug the cable in and go.
- **Android (Chrome):** uses WebUSB through a USB-OTG adapter (Web Serial isn't available on Android, WebUSB is).

## What it does

1. **Connect** to the cable (Web Serial or WebUSB).
2. **Identify** the device (`0x21` handshake → confirms 0BA6, IdentNo `0x43`/`0x44`/`0x45`).
3. **Self-test** by reading the program name — confirms the address mapping before you trust a dump.
4. **Dump** the raw program memory to a `.bin`.
5. **Decode** the pointer table + I/O wiring + program into a readable **netlist** (e.g. `B001 = OR(B002, I2)`, `Q1 = B001`).

## Status / accuracy

- Basic gates (AND/OR/NOT/NAND/NOR/XOR + edge variants) and output/marker wiring are decoded **exactly** (validated against the reverse-engineered spec).
- Special functions (timers, counters, message text) are **named** with their raw bytes shown; numeric parameters aren't interpreted yet.
- The USB-serial chip drivers for the WebUSB (Android) path (CP210x / CH340 / FTDI) are best-effort and untested on all silicon; the desktop Web Serial path is robust.
- **Requires STOP mode** on the device for memory reads.

## Development

The app is TypeScript in `src/`, compiled to ES modules in `dist/` (no bundler; the browser
loads the modules natively). `index.html` references `./dist/main.js`.

```sh
npm install --ignore-scripts   # dev deps only (typescript, eslint); no runtime deps
npm run typecheck              # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint                   # eslint (js + typescript-eslint recommendedTypeChecked)
npm run build                 # tsc → dist/
```

To run locally, build and serve the repo root over HTTP (module scripts need `http(s)://`, not
`file://`), e.g. `python3 -m http.server` then open `http://localhost:8000/`.

Module layout: `transport/` (Web Serial + WebUSB byte pipes) → `pg/` (the `Connection` class,
which owns the transport and is the only thing that speaks the PG protocol) → `actions/`
(operations that orchestrate a Connection + the `state/` store) → `ui/` (DOM wiring). Protocol
and program-format facts live in `PROTOCOL.md`; the investigation log is `LAB-NOTEBOOK.md`.

Deployment is automatic: pushing to `main` runs `.github/workflows/pages.yml`, which builds and
publishes to GitHub Pages. `dist/` is not committed.

### Recording hardware sessions

Real device sessions are saved as fixtures in `test/fixtures/*.session` and replayed against the
fake by `test/session-replay.test.ts`, which asserts the fake produces the exact recorded bytes
— so the fakes can't silently drift away from what real hardware did. To capture a new session:

1. Run the tool against a device, then press **Download log** (or **Copy log**).
2. Save it as `test/fixtures/<device>-<date>.session`.
3. Add a header line describing the device, e.g.
   `# device: identNo=45 mode=42 passwordExists=1 leaksCleartext=0 blockReadsWork=0`
   (hex for `identNo`/`mode`; `1`/`0` for the flags). The replay test parses `→ … ← …` lines and
   ignores everything else. Per-byte region reads aren't individual log lines, so they're skipped.
4. `npm test` — the new session is picked up automatically. A failure means the fake and the real
   capture disagree; reconcile the fake (and PROTOCOL.md) with the observation.

This project **reimplements** the protocol and block format for the browser; it does not copy code from the above.
